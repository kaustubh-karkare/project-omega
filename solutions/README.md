## General Instructions

- This directory will contain the results of the assignments submitted by the various participants of this exercise.
- If a subdirectory with your name does not exist, create one using the naming scheme: lower-case-separated-by-dashes.
- Within your subdirectory, please use a reasonable naming scheme, like "assignment-1.py" or "assignment-2/index.js" that makes it easy to figure out which assignment your code is for. Please use a separate pull-request for your solution to each assignment.
- Your assignment is considered complete when your pull request successfully passes code review. At that time, the pull request will be closed, but your code will NOT be merged into the main repository.
- While I have no way of enforcing this, I ask that you do not look at other people's work for a given assignment, unless you've completed it yourself. This will ensure that your own learning experience is unaffected.
